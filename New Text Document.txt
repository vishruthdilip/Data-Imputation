Handling missing data
Three very commonly used techniques.
- Delete the records containing missing values (only when the data set is huge)
- Create a separate training model to predict the missing values (not feasible because it takes a lot of time and effort)
- Statistical methods (mean, median, mode)


What is data imputation? 
It is the process of substituting the missing values in the dataset with some number based on certain standard principles or techniques.
It is on of the most import parts of the feature engineering pipeline.
